# URIs and URLs

URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are two related concepts that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.

A URI is a string of characters that identifies a name or a resource. It can be used to identify anything, not necessarily a location on the web. For example, a URI can be used to identify a file on a local computer, an email address, or a telephone number.

A URL is a type of URI that specifies the location of a resource on the web. It consists of several components, including the protocol, the domain name, the port number, the path, and the query string. For example, the URL `"https://www.google.com/search?q=example"` specifies the protocol (https), the domain name (`www.google.com`), the path (`/search`), and the query string (`?q=example`) of a web page.

In short, a URL is a type of URI that specifies the location of a resource on the web.

## URL

A URL is a Uniform Resource Locator that provides a way to identify and locate resources on the internet. It is composed of several components that work together to specify the location of a resource.

Here is an example URL:

`https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param=value#fragment`

Each component in this URL serves a specific purpose:

- **Protocol/Schema:** The protocol or schema specifies the communication protocol to be used when accessing the resource. In this example, the protocol is `https`, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. Other common protocols include `http`, `ftp`, `mailto`, `file`, etc. The protocol is followed by a colon and two forward slashes.
- **Domain/Host:** The domain or host specifies the network location of the resource, typically a website or server. In this example, the domain is `www.example.com`.
- **Port:** The port number specifies the communication port on the server that should be used to access the resource. If no port is specified, the default port for the protocol is used. In this example, the port number is `8080`.
- **Path:** The path specifies the location of the resource on the server's file system. In this example, the path is `/path/to/resource`.
- **Query Parameters:** Query parameters allow additional information to be passed to the server, typically in the form of key-value pairs. The parameters are separated from the path by a question mark, and each parameter is separated from the next by an ampersand. In this example, the parameter `param` has a value of `value`.
- **Fragment Identifier:** The fragment identifier identifies a specific section of the resource, such as a subsection of a web page. It is preceded by a hash symbol. In this example, the fragment identifier is `fragment`.

Each of these components works together to specify the complete location of a resource on the internet. By understanding how URLs are structured, developers can use them to locate and access resources as needed.

## Working with URLs

In Rust, the standard library provides a `url` crate for working with URLs. This crate provides a `Url` struct, which represents a parsed URL.

To parse a URL, you can use the `Url::parse` method, which returns a Result containing a Url object if the parsing was successful, or an error if the input string is not a valid URL. For example:

```rs
use url::Url;

fn main() {
    let url_string = "https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?key=value#fragment";
    let url = Url::parse(url_string).expect("failed to parse URL");

    println!("Scheme: {}", url.scheme());
    println!("Host: {}", url.host_str().expect("no host found"));
    println!("Port: {:?}", url.port_or_known_default());
    println!("Path: {}", url.path());
    println!("Query string: {}", url.query().unwrap_or(""));
    println!("Fragment: {}", url.fragment().unwrap_or(""));
}
```

To modify a URL, you can use the various methods provided by the `Url` struct, such as `set_scheme`, `set_host`, `set_path`, `set_query`, and `set_fragment`. These methods return a new Url object with the modification applied, while leaving the original Url object unchanged. For example:

```rs
use url::Url;

let mut url = Url::parse("https://example.com/path?query=string#fragment").unwrap();

url.set_scheme("http").unwrap();
url.set_host(Some("sub.example.com")).unwrap();
url.set_path("/new/path");
url.set_query(Some("new=query&string=here"));
url.set_fragment(Some("new-fragment"));

assert_eq!(url.to_string(), "http://sub.example.com/new/path?new=query&string=here#new-fragment");
```

To build a new URL from scratch, you can create a `Url` object with a base URL and use the join method to append path segments, query parameters, and fragments. For example:

```rs
use url::Url;

let base_url = Url::parse("https://example.com").unwrap();

let url = base_url.join("/path").unwrap();
let url = url.join("?query=string").unwrap();
let url = url.join("#fragment").unwrap();

assert_eq!(url.to_string(), "https://example.com/path?query=string#fragment");
```

The `Url` type also supports parsing and resolution of relative URLs, which are URLs that are not fully qualified and are resolved against a base URL. For example:

```rs
use url::Url;

let base = Url::parse("https://example.com/foo/bar").unwrap();
let relative = "../baz/qux";
let resolved = base.join(relative).unwrap();
assert_eq!(resolved.as_str(), "https://example.com/baz/qux");
```

The `Url` type provides several methods for working with query parameters, which are key-value pairs that appear after the `?` character in a URL.

```rs
use url::Url;

let mut url = Url::parse("https://example.com/foo?bar=baz").unwrap();
url.query_pairs_mut().append_pair("qux", "quux");
```

In some cases, URLs may contain query parameters. The url crate provides an easy way to parse these parameters using the query_pairs method. Here's an example:

```rs
use std::collections::HashMap;
use url::Url;

fn main() {
    let url = Url::parse("https://example.com/search?q=rust&sort=desc").unwrap();

    let query_params = url
        .query_pairs()
        .map(|p| (p.0.into_owned(), p.1.into_owned()))
        .collect::<HashMap<_, _>>();

    for (key, value) in query_params {
        println!("{}={}", key, value);
    }
}
```

In Rust, you can use the serde_urlencoded crate to parse the query parameters of a URL into a `HashMap<String, String>`.

```rs
use std::collections::HashMap;

use serde_urlencoded;

fn main() {
    let url = "https://example.com/search?q=hello+world&limit=10";
    let parsed_url = url::Url::parse(url).unwrap();

    let query_params: HashMap<String, String> =
        serde_urlencoded::from_str(parsed_url.query().unwrap_or_default()).unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", query_params);
}
```

## Example code

```rs
use url::Url;

fn get_domain_name_from_url(url: &str) -> Option<String> {
    let url_obj = Url::parse(url).ok()?;
    Some(url_obj.host_str()?.to_string())
}

fn main() {
    let bootdev_url = "https://boot.dev/learn/learn-python";
    if let Some(domain_name) = get_domain_name_from_url(bootdev_url) {
        println!("The domain name for {} is {}", bootdev_url, domain_name);
    } else {
        println!("Could not get domain name for {}", bootdev_url);
    }
}
```

Subdomains are a way to organize and separate different sections or services of a website or domain. They are defined as a part of the domain name that comes before the main domain name and separated by a dot (.) symbol.

For example, in the URL `https://blog.example.com`, `blog` is a subdomain of `example.com`.

Subdomains can be used for a variety of purposes, such as separating different services or products of a website, creating language-specific versions of a website, or hosting different websites on the same domain.

Here's an example Rust code that extracts the subdomain from a given URL:

```rs
use url::Url;

fn get_subdomain(url: &str) -> Option<String> {
    let url = Url::parse(url).ok()?;
    let subdomains = url.host_str()?.split('.').collect::<Vec<_>>();
    subdomains.first().map(|&v| v.to_owned())
}

fn main() {
    let url = "https://subdomain.example.com/path";
    let subdomain = get_subdomain(url).unwrap_or("None".to_owned());
    println!("Subdomain: {}", subdomain);
}
```

## Ports

A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system that allows a computer to access a network service. It is a 16-bit unsigned integer that ranges from 0 to 65535. Ports are used by computers to identify and differentiate network traffic among different services and applications. For example, when a client connects to a web server over the internet, the client sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address and port 80, which is the default port for HTTP traffic.

In the context of URLs, ports are specified as part of the authority component of the URL. The authority component includes the user information, host name, and port number. The general syntax of a URL with an authority component is:

```yaml
[scheme:][//[user:password@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]
```

The port is specified as a colon followed by the port number after the hostname. For example, the URL `https://example.com:8080/path/to/resource` specifies that the web server for the domain example.com should be accessed using port `8080`.

If no port is specified in the URL, the default port for the scheme is used. For example, the default port for HTTP is `80`, and the default port for HTTPS is `443`.

```rs
use std::error::Error;

use url::Url;

fn get_port_number(url: &str) -> Option<u16> {
    let parsed_url = Url::parse(url).ok()?;
    let port = match parsed_url.port_or_known_default() {
        Some(port) => port,
        None => return None,
    };
    Some(port)
}

fn set_port_number(url: &str, port: u16) -> Result<String, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut parsed_url = Url::parse(url)?;
    parsed_url
        .set_port(Some(port))
        .map_err(|_| "cannot be base")?;
    Ok(parsed_url.to_string())
}

```
