# DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet. In simpler terms, DNS is a system that translates domain names, which are easier for humans to remember, into IP addresses, which are used by computers to identify each other on the Internet.

When a user types a domain name in a web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which then queries a DNS server to obtain the IP address associated with that domain name. Once the IP address is obtained, the browser can then establish a connection to the web server hosting the website and retrieve the content.

DNS plays a critical role in the functioning of the Internet by allowing users to access resources using domain names instead of IP addresses, which are difficult to remember and can change frequently. It also enables load balancing and fault tolerance by allowing multiple IP addresses to be associated with a single domain name, and it helps prevent malicious activities such as phishing and malware distribution by allowing domain names to be blacklisted.

## IP Addresses

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two primary functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.

In IPv4, an IP address is represented as a 32-bit number, and in IPv6, it is represented as a 128-bit number. IPv4 addresses are commonly expressed in the decimal format, while IPv6 addresses are typically written as hexadecimal numbers.

IP addresses are used in many networking protocols, including HTTP, which is the protocol used for web communication. When a user enters a URL in their web browser, the browser uses the domain name to look up the IP address of the server hosting the website. The browser then sends an HTTP request to the server using the IP address, which the server uses to route the request to the appropriate web page.

## IPv4

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP) that is widely used in communication networks, including the Internet. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, which are typically expressed in dotted decimal notation, where each 8-bit number is represented as a decimal number separated by a dot. For example, the IP address `192.0.2.1` is an example of an IPv4 address.

IPv4 addresses are divided into two parts: the network address and the host address. The network address identifies the network to which the host belongs, while the host address identifies the specific host on the network. The division between the network address and the host address is determined by a subnet mask, which is a 32-bit number that is used to indicate which bits in the IP address represent the network address and which bits represent the host address.

IPv4 addresses are used to route packets between different networks, and they are assigned to devices on the network by a network administrator or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The number of available IPv4 addresses is limited, and this has led to the development of IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses and provides a much larger address space.

## IPv6

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and it provides a larger address space compared to IPv4. The IPv6 address space is 128 bits, which is much larger than the 32-bit IPv4 address space. This enables IPv6 to support a much larger number of devices and networks than IPv4.

IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons. An example of an IPv6 address is `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. IPv6 addresses can also have leading zeros removed, so the same address can be written as `2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334`.

IPv6 also includes new features such as improved security, better support for mobile devices, and simplified network configuration. However, IPv6 adoption has been slow due to the need for updates to existing networking infrastructure and devices.

## Example Code

```rs
use serde::Deserialize;
use std::error::Error;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct DnsResolver {
    client: reqwest::Client,
}

impl DnsResolver {
    fn new() -> DnsResolver {
        DnsResolver {
            client: reqwest::Client::new(),
        }
    }

    async fn resolve(&self, domain: &str) -> Result<Option<String>, Box<dyn Error>> {
        let url = format!(
            "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name={}&type=A",
            domain
        );

        let resp = self
            .client
            .get(&url)
            .header("accept", "application/dns-json")
            .send()
            .await?
            .json::<DNSResponse>()
            .await?;
        let answer = resp.answer;
        let ip_address = answer.iter().find_map(|r| {
            if r.record_type == 1 {
                Some(r.data.clone())
            } else {
                None
            }
        });

        Ok(ip_address)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct DNSRecord {
    #[serde(rename = "type")]
    record_type: u8,
    data: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct DNSResponse {
    #[serde(rename = "Answer")]
    answer: Vec<DNSRecord>,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let domain = "api.boot.dev";
    let dns_resolver = DnsResolver::new();
    let ip_address = dns_resolver.resolve(domain).await?;

    match ip_address {
        Some(ip) => println!("Found IP address for domain {}: {}", domain, ip),
        None => println!("No IP address found for domain {}", domain),
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

In this implementation, the `DnsResolver` struct contains a `reqwest::Client` instance and a single `resolve` method that performs the DNS lookup for the given domain name. The method sends an HTTP GET request to the Cloudflare DNS API and deserializes the response into a `DnsResponse` struct. It then searches for the first A record in the response and returns its IP address as an `Option<String>`. The `main` function creates a new `DnsResolver` instance, calls its `resolve` method for the `api.boot.dev` domain, and prints the IP address if it was found.
